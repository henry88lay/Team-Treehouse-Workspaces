// What are the main concepts / ideas / facts I just learned? This act of recall helps your memory get stronger.
I have learned the overall barebone structure of a website via HTML


// Can you explain those concepts in your own words? Write this down in a journal, in a document, or even in a Treehouse workspace
This is essentially the basic structure for any given website.


// Can you relate those concepts to things you already know? Compare and contrast with similar concepts you already know: how are they similar or different. This adds meaning to what you've learned based on things you already understand.
